# Malin Space Satellite Project :artificial_satellite: :artificial_satellite:

:round_pushpin: This application is designed to manage and analyse complex datasets obtained during satellite operations.

:white_small_square: It utilises two advanced sorting algorithms, namely Selection and Insertion sort, and two binary searching techniques, Recursive and Iterative binary search, to enable users to compare the processing of raw data as it is collected.

:white_small_square: The satellite sensors generate a stream of raw numerical data as the satellite passes over the receiving station. 

:white_small_square: This data is then transmitted and saved onto a server for further analysis.

:white_small_square: To process the data, the application utilises the Galileo DLL and two LinkedLists, one for each sensor.

:white_small_square: This application reads the data from each sensor into a simple LinkedList of type “double”, which is then sorted using the Selection and Iteration sort algorithms.

:white_small_square: The user can enter a value into a search textbox and choose between Recursive or Iterative binary search algorithms to search for the value. 

:white_small_square: The processing time for all four algorithms is measured and displayed to the user.
